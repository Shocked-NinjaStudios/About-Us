We first started as a Unity game company with only unreleased games but it soon changed when we gave up and started focusing on Roblox games. We saved R$100 by just creating a account for Shocked Ninja Studios in Roblox instead. It also gave us user benfits we wanted so creatinge one was a good option! We soon published our first ever Roblox Game. And now we have lots of games currently working on like Robox 360.
